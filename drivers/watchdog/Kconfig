	help
	  Enable driver model for watchdog timer. At the moment the API
	  is very simple and only supports three operations:
	  start, restart and stop. The uclass is not concerned with
	  what happends when the timer expires, it is up to a particular
	  driver.

config WDT_ASPEED
	bool "Aspeed ast2400/ast2500 watchdog timer support"
	depends on WDT
	default y if ARCH_ASPEED
	help
	  Select this to enable watchdog timer for Aspeed ast2500/ast2400 devices.
	  The watchdog timer is stopped when initialized. It performs reset, either
	  full SoC reset or CPU or just some peripherals, based on the flags.
	  It currently does not support Boot Flash Addressing Mode Detection or
	  Second Boot.
